# Auto Complete in C++
In this assignment we implemented a ternary search tree (TST) data structure for strings. Also, text auto-complete functionality was implemented using dictionary ADT with 3 different datastructures  (Balanced BST, TST, HashSet). To analyse the performance, compared the empirical running time of TSTs, Balanced Binary Search Trees and Hash Tables to their expected analytical running times. And, we researched and compared the performance of different hash functions for strings.

For without them, the GUI for this PA would not be possible. They have gone through long, hard nights and learned how to code in QT from scratch to produce this beautiful code in roughly a week. All the while they put up with spontaneous source file changes, my design suggestions and my lack of punctuality, and they made sure this GUI launched with the assignment. For any students who read this, please let any of the GUI team that you see know that they are awesome and are dripping with awesomesauce. --Jor-el
